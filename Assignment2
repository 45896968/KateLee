### Question 1
## a
Load data

```{r}
summary(paramo)
```
AR and EL are correlated with each other

```{r}
cor(paramo)
```
Diagonals are 1, meaning variables has perfect correlation with itself.

## b

Fitting a model
```{r}
paramo.lm=lm(N~AR+EL+DEc+DNI, data = paramo)
summary(paramo.lm)
```
N abundance

Overall ANOVA
```{r}
anova(paramo.lm)
```
Conducting an F test for overall regression

Model
$$
Full Reg_ss=RegSS_AR+RegSS_EL|AR+Reg_DEc|AR,EL+RegSS_DNI|AR,EL,DEc
$$
$$
=508+45.90+537.39+2.06 =1094.27
$$
$$
Reg MS=\frac{RegSS}{K}=\frac{1094.27}{4}=273.568
$$

Null Hypothesis
$$
H_0:\beta_AR=\beta_EL=\beta_DEc=\beta_DNI=0 
$$
Alternate Hypothesis
$$
H_1: not all \beta_i=0
$$
Test Statistic
$$
F_obs= \frac{RegMS}{Res MS}=\frac{273.568}{44.95}=6.086
$$
P value
$$
=P(F_4,_9\geqslant6.086)=0.01181 > 0.01
$$
Conclusion
Reject null hypothesis at the 5% level, strong evidence that not all means are equal to 0. 



## c

Validating model using all the predictors
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
qqnorm(paramo.lm$residuals, main = "Noraml Q-Q plot of residuals")
plot(paramo.lm$fitted.values, paramo.lm$residuals, main = "Residuals vs Fitted", xlab = "Fitted", ylab = "Residuals")
```
The graph shows that it is appropriate to a multiple regression model 
The N abundance value means

##d
$$
R^2 = \frac{SS Regression}{SS Total}
= \frac{SS Total-SS Residuals}{SS Total}
= \frac{1498.86-404.59}{1498.86}
=0.73
$$
It is the goodness of fit for linear regression model.


##e
The best multiple regression model that explains the data is the Multiple Linear Regression. 
That is:
```{r}
paramo.lm=lm(N~AR+EL+DEc+DNI, data= paramo)
```

##f


### Question 2

## a
For this study, the design is balanced. This is because:
* All groups had equal sizes
* The sum of squares were easy to obtain using simple equations
* Could do this by hand if we wanted to

## b
Two preliminary graphs that investigate different features of data
```{r}
interaction.plot(TreeShrews.dat$Sleep, TreeShrews.dat$Shrews, TreeShrews.dat$HeartRates, trace.label = "Quality", xlab = "Sleep", ylab = "HeartRates")
```
There is a very strong interaction with shrews 2, 5, 6 and 3. It overlaps each other and are not parallel. There isn't much interaction between 3 and 4 as they are kind of parallel and follow the same pattern. All shrews are not parallel indicating strong interaction. 

```{r}
boxplot(TreeShrews.dat$HeartRates~TreeShrews.dat$Shrews+TreeShrews.dat$Sleep)
```
This box plot shows that:
*

## c
We cannot fit a Two-Way ANOVA with interaction model to this dataset because:
* The population from which the samples are obtained are not normally distributed.
*The variances among population is not equal

## d
Model
$$
Y_ij=\mu+\epsilon_ij; \epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma^2)
$$

Null Hypothesis and alternate hypothesis
$$ 
H_0: \mu_0=\mu_1=...=\mu_6
$$

$$
H_1: Not all means are equal
$$
$$
F_obs= \frac{MS Treatment}{MS Residuals}=\frac{39.43}{11.64}=3.387\sim F_3, _3
$$
P-Value= 0.0843 

which is more than 0.05, do not reject H0. 

Conclusion: Do not reject Ho. We have evidence that all means are equal.
